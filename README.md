# Houston Hackathon Donation Platform

## General

- Idea
  - A platform for connecting users who need specific items (e.g. food, clothes, household supplies, school supplies, etc.) to users who can provide those items
  - Possibly integrate large donation centers and non-profit organizations (e.g. Good Will, Salvation Army, etc.) if possible/necessary

- How It Works
  - Users who need specific item(s) can
    - Make a posting in a specific category (e.g. food, clothing, etc.) for item(s) they need
    - Search for item(s) that have a posting
  - Users who want to donate specific item(s) can
    - Make a posting in a specific category for item(s) they can donate
    - Search for postings that they can donate to 

- Benefits
  - Directly connect to users and skip the middleman
  - Find specific items more quickly
